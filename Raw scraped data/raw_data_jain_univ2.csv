As you can see, our college is a Tier 2 college and is still improving. The highest package the student secures is 30 LPA, while the average is 12 LPA. Aroon Aviation, the airport authority of India, is hiring students. The internship companies that come to college are not that great; they just need an employee with a degree and a low salary.","Infrastructure: College life is really fun. There are a lot of facilities provided by the college; they provide Wi-Fi with high-speed internet. I mostly like labs that have aviation engines, parts, and bodies; they are useful for studying.

We have indoor and outdoor sports courts, and most students love to play indoor sports.","Faculty: Teachers and course both are practical-oriented; mostly, weightage is given to practical. Teachers use labs, the aviation model, and theoretical lectures in their teaching. MBA Aviation is a rare course; it is not offered by many companies, but our college has a good course structure; it is affiliated with Jain University, which is deemed industry-oriented. Semester exams are practical, and theoretical passing needs at least 40%.","Other: I chose this course because it is relevant to marketing strategy.

Big companies like Asian Paints, Deloitte, Morgan Stanley etc came to campus and also small companies visited like SISA, Hirecraft and Magnasoft which were not very pleasing.

It focuses more on collecting money.","Placements: This college does not provide good placements. The brochure and everything provided is fraud and fake here. The fee is also very high in this college, but it is not worth it. There are many colleges in Bangalore with low fees structure for the MBA field and provide good placements. But this Jain college only focuses on earning money, and it doesn't care about the student's personality development. Our college just provides assignments, which are a waste of time and money. So, I suggest our college not to provide assignments rather than it should spend time on the personal development of students. I suggest students not to join this college, and it is a waste of your money.","Infrastructure: For some circumstances, our college is good, but it is not a proper lush green campus. Students don't get a spacious and fresh environment, and they can't sustain here.

Canteen facilities and everything is not suitable for 800 students. Our college doesn't care about placements.","Faculty: Faculty members are also very old here. Most of the students can't be able to understand the study curriculum designed here and what they are teaching in the class. Most of the teachers behave rudely with students, and they don't have knowledge about academics. In the 2019 year, our college provided admission for around 800 students, i.e., it is giving admission to every student. It charges a fee of around 9.5 lac to every student, but it is not worth it. Courses which they provided here are good, but the basic course contents are not at all up to the mark. I would suggest you to verify about everything before joining in any college. I was harassed many times in this college. Now our college focuses more on collecting money through admissions, and it is a waste college.","Other: The events are good, and they are conducted very well, joining a forum helps students enjoy college life.

They are also personally helpful like if u have any doubt you can personally go to staff room and ask. Teaching quality is good sometimes they teach with the led by showing pictures and videos so that we can easily understand. Average class strength is 60-70 students in a class.,Other: I wish we had a campus. It's literally just a small building built in between numerous tech parks. And the entire college's strength isn't more than 500 students. Like even our schools had better crowd and infrastructure.,,,,

More than 100 companies come to our college to select students from our campus. Big companies like delloite, pwc, Dell, Morgan Stanley, sbi life, airtel, tech mahindra, castrol, Axis bank, Citibank, coca cola, etc. Selects students from our campus. Jain university gives 99% placements guarantee. 1% is because if a students doesn't knows anything then how can any company selects such person. And if you ask about package average package will be 30k p. m. which is pretty good figure for a B.Com graduate.","Infrastructure: The classrooms are decent. However, it is a single structure building, there are no facilities for outdoor games. Nevertheless, the college is worth appreciation. The campus is centrally air-conditioned. Our college is in the centre of the city and has a lot of facilities around it like malls, hotels, small eateries, etc.","Faculty: Jain University has a mixed group of faculty. Some faculty members are good, but it is up to you because if you have taken CA with B.Com, then faculty doesn't matter much because, after that, the students have to study on their own.","Other: As cybersecurity is getting into hike in next few years, so I chose this course. If you have interest in coding and bounties then this course is best for you. There is no scholarship for BCA course in this college. The events are arranged by a forum in the college.",,,,

It promises the students who have opted CA to get articleship in the big four companies, but the reality comes with a lot of conditions. However, the other B.Com students get placed in some of the big names, which is positive about Jain University.","Infrastructure: Classrooms are decent. The campus has only one building and doesn't have facilities for outdoor games. Nevertheless, the college is worth appreciation. It has centralised air-conditioning facilities. It is in the centre of the city and has a lot of facilities like malls, hotels, small eateries, etc., in the surroundings.","Faculty: Some of the faculty members are really good.

It promises the students who opt for CA for getting an articleship in the big 4 companies, but the reality comes with a lot of conditions. However, the B.Com students get placed in some of the big names which is a big positive point about Jain University.","Infrastructure: The Wi-Fi facility is not at all useful as they provide just 20 MB. Air-conditioners and fans are available in classrooms, but they don't work. There is a ground for all games. Only a single building is present in the college, and there are 2-3 nets present in the basement, to play cricket. The quality of food in the canteen is average, and they don't serve non-vegetarian food. Hostel facilities are average for the money you pay. The library present in the college is good. The main problem is the infrastructure; it is not huge. The college accommodates 85 students in a small class, and after a year, they divide the class into two sections. The students are not encouraged to participate in any sport in the college.","Faculty: The faculty members in the college are underqualified to teach the course/syllabus. The college mainly recruits freshers as teaching faculty, and most of them work part-time. They don't even engage the class, and they just enter the class and waste an hour, teaching nothing. Their teaching quality is very poor, and a few faculty members don't even know how to teach. The course the college offers is good, but they are not able to deliver the things they promised at the time of admission. The coordinators are very rude to students.","Other: This course is very good because it provides many opportunities to learn about application development in college only, and you don't have to pay additional fees for this. Events are very less in our college. Our college hardly conducts any event in the whole year. Only an Infinity event is conducted in our college. Our college surroundings are not developed enough because it is 30 km from the city. If you want to go city, then you have to take a bus. It takes two hours to reach into main Bangalore city.",,,,

They help you with any kind of academic situations, but the only drawback with Jain University, Christ University, and the others is that they come under tier 3 universities. If you are choosing this college, it is better to opt for Bangalore University because 70% in Jain University is equal to 60% in Bangalore University, and you have to face when you enrol for masters abroad.","Other: The campus is good in all things. I chose CSE because of my interest in coding and our college also provides placements for IT field students. We used to take the bus.
